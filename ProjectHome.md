<a href='http://code.google.com/p/vrblog/source/browse/trunk/com/vasilrem/hudson/ftpcourier/FTPCourier.groovy'>FTPCourier</a> is a small utility written in Groovy that copies artefacts generated by the Hudson job to FTP. You can register this utility as a Hudson job and create dependency to the other project, so artefact will be copied right when the project is built.
